# Introducing Build a Server-rendered ReactJS application with Next.js

The easiest way to get started with a next application is to use `create-next-app`

```terminal
npx create-next-app nextjs-blog-app
```

This well set up a basic next application for you, including the `run` script in the `package.json`.

📝 - With the recent release of Next.js 10, there are even more new features to explore, including accessibility and new analytics.

The [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) are a great place to get up to speed quickly.

From your project directory, you can run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
