## Notes

- Letâ€™s imagine a scenario where we want to share our `localStorage` code with other components so other components could synchronize state with `localStorage`.

- Considering how code reuse works in JavaScript in general, we can simply make a function, put our relevant code in that function, and then call it from the original location. That process works exactly the same with React hooks code, so letâ€™s do that:

- **Original code**:

```js
const [name, setName] = React.useState(
  () => window.localStorage.getItem('name') || ''
);

React.useEffect(() => {
  window.localStorage.setItem('name', name);
}, [name]);
```

- **Refactor code** to a reusable custom hooks:

```js
//
function useLocalStorageState(key, defaultValue = '') {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState(
    () => window.localStorage.getItem(key) || defaultValue
  );

  React.useEffect(() => {
    window.localStorage.setItem(key, state);
  }, [key, state]);

  return [state, setState];
}
```

```html
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.12.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.12.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone@7.8.3/babel.js"></script>
  <script type="text/babel">
    // the community standard is to use `useWhateverName` following React Hooks name standards
    // providing key for localStorage and defaultValue
    function useLocalStorageState(key, defaultValue = '') {
      const [state, setState] = React.useState(
        () => window.localStorage.getItem(key) || defaultValue
      );

      React.useEffect(() => {
        window.localStorage.setItem(key, state);
        // Make sure to add key to our array
      }, [key, state]);
      // Getting access to state and setState
      // a custom Hook doesnâ€™t need to have a specific signature.
      // We can decide what it takes as arguments
      return [state, setState];
    }

    function Greeting() {
      // calling our useLocalStorageState
      const [name, setName] = useLocalStorageState('name');

      const handleChange = event => setName(event.target.value);

      return (
        <div>
          <form>
            <label htmlFor="name">Name: </label>
            <input value={name} onChange={handleChange} id="name" />
          </form>
          {name ? <strong>Hello {name}</strong> : 'Please type your name'}
        </div>
      );
    }

    ReactDOM.render(<Greeting />, document.getElementById('root'));
  </script>
</body>
```

- When we want to share logic between two JavaScript functions, we extract it to a third function. Both components and Hooks are functions, so this works for them too!
- Building your own Hooks lets you extract component logic into reusable functions.

  Sharing logic in a react app is just as straightforward as it is in vanilla JavaScript.

  You can compose custom hooks with existing hooks. Just as you could in vanilla JavaScript with functions.

  By returning `[state, setState]` you are creating an API identical to `useState`, making your custom hook more intuitive for users.

  We can name custom hooks whatever we want, but the reason that it's a convention to preface their name with `use` is so that eslint plugins can recognize our custom hooks.
