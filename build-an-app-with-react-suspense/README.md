## About 🔍

This repo contains notes from [Michael Chan](https://twitter.com/chantastic)'s Egghead course [Build an App with React Suspense](https://egghead.io/courses/build-an-app-with-react-suspense?af=4cexzz).

These notes contain the same structure as the transcriptions, along with additional rewrites, links to resources, and personal takes on the lesson. Feel free to submit additions to these notes, but please don't remove anything (unless we messed up or misunderstood something).

Generally, there is one document for each lesson in the course. If there are related lessons, the notes will be in the same document.

## Course Objective 💪

You've probably already heard of React Suspsense and the big change that this new API will create in the way that we develop our React apps. This course serve as an introduction to the current state of this yet EXPERIMENTAL API.

React Suspense gives us a new way of describing with fine-grain controls how users experience should look based on data we have or don’t have.

You'll learn what changes this new API add to React and how to leverage the power that brings with it to create better applications and UX.


By the end of the course you'll not only have a good understanding of (some of) Suspense features, you'll also have a working application to show off.


## Prerequisites ✅

During this course we're going to talk quite a bit about React current API. So is required that you already know about how to create an application with React.
