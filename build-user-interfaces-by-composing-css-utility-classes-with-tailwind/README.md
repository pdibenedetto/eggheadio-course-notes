## About

This repo contains notes on [Simon Vrachliotis](https://egghead.io/instructors/simon-vrachliotis)'s collection [Build User Interfaces by Composing CSS Utility Classes with Tailwind](https://egghead.io/courses/build-user-interfaces-by-composing-css-utility-classes-with-tailwind). These notes follow along with the collection and guide you as you install, configure, and create components using: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Course Objective

In this course, you'll learn how to handle responsive breakpoints, how to trigger specific element states, how to handle specificity, how to keep your bundle file size in check, and how to seamlessly extend Tailwind with your own custom utility classes.

By the end of the course, you should have a firm understanding of how Tailwind works and be able to create your own tailor-made design system and utility class CSS toolkit for your next project!
